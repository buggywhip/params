In this repository are prime numbers, some safe primes, that are 
the result of time consuming calculations.  Generally speaking, 
these primes can be used as parameters for the Diffie-Hellman 
key exchange, and may be safely reused [repeatedly] with a high 
modicum of safety.  

I calculated them and have high confidence in their correctness, 
but being posted on the Internet means you should be suspect.  
Feel free to use them, but I strongly urge you to double check 
them for primality as some nefarious soul may have changed them.

THESE NUMBERS ARE MADE AVAILABLE "AS-IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OR GUARANTEE OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, UNDER ANY AND
ALL CONDITIONS, NO EXCEPTIONS.  USE SIGNIFIES ACCEPTANCE OF
ALL RISK.

The numbers are free for any use.
